# Assessing Reliability of Explanations in Unbalanced Datasets: A Use-Case on the Occurrence of Frost Events
Authors: Ilaria Vascotto, Valentina Blasone, Alex Rodriguez, Alessandro Bonaita, Luca Bortolussi

This repository stores the code for the paper "Assessing Reliability of Explanations in Unbalanced Datasets: a Use-Case on the Occurrence of Frost Events", presented as Late Breaking Work at the 3rd World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, held in Istanbul (Turkey) on July 9-11, 2025.
The preprint of the paper can be found at this [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09545), while awaiting publication. 

As specified in the paper, the data and the model are proprietary therefore some of the information cannot be shared publicly. We have added to this repository the files and the script used to prepare the figures which are present in the paper and two scritps which were used to retrive the feature importance, compute the ensemble aggregation and stored the robustness scores, as well as the distance needed for the consistency computation. 

The missing files are, notably, the training, validation and test sets, the model definition and model weights. 

We aim at including in this repository an analysis based on publicly-available dataset to increase transparency.

A summary of the proposed pipeline is presented in the following:
